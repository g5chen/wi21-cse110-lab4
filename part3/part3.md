What was the bug?
The variable result is undefined since there were missing ";" at the end of the line 8 and 10.

How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix.
I added ";" at the end of line 8 and line 10, then call calculateSum(2,3), it gives correct output 5.
see screenshot named part3fixed.
